## Quick Look plugin for Kindle ebook formats

QLMobi plugin supports various ebook formats used on kindle readers. It is based on [libmobi] and works with all the formats supported by the library: `prc`, `mobi`, `azw`, `azw3`, `azw4` and some `pdb` files. The plugin will generate a thumbnail, based on document embedded cover, and a preview for its content.

### Installation

#### Homebrew

QLMobi can be installed via [Homebrew-Cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask).

```bash
brew install --cask qlmobi
```

#### Manual

Place the plugin file: [QLMobi.qlgenerator][binary] into `~/Library/QuickLook/` folder to install it for your account, or into `(Macintosh HD)/Library/QuickLook/` folder to install it for all users. If the folder does not exist, create it manually. 

### Building

Source code is available on [github][qlmobi]. It is bundled as an Xcode project and depends on the [libmobi] library.

### Troubleshooting
 
If the plugin doesn't work:
- reload plugins running `qlmanage -r` from the console;  
- try reinstalling the plugin;
- try in the top level `Library` folder instead of the user's one;
- go to github [issues] tab, start new issue describing your problem, you may also provide output of the command: `qlmanage -d 4 -p -o /tmp /path/to/your/test.mobi`.

If you're on Catalina or later, and you get "QLMobi.qlgenerator cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified", run in a terminal:

```
$ xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine ~/Library/QuickLook/QLMobi.qlgenerator
$ qlmanage -r
```
